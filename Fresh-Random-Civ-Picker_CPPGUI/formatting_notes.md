# Convention Compliance of FRCP

**Ensuring that the code is readable, congruent, consistent, and cohesive.
I work to make formatting and naming throughout my code coherent and easily understandable.
This document is to track my progress in making the code convention compliant. I use this 
document a guideline to return to.**


Goals:

	- Make all function names camel case.
 
	- Make all function names begin with a verb.

	- Make all variable names snake case.

	- Make all variable names begin with a noun.

 	- Make line spacing consistent and avoid excessive line spaces.

  	- Make sure naming is as self explanatory as possible.
