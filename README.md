## Purpose
The user can randomly iterate through the entire civ pool or a user-defined civ pool without drawing the same civ twice.

## What is this application?
This is an application which generates a randomly drawn civilisation out of the civilisations available to play in a computer game called "Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition" which is a real-time strategy game. What my application offers which the random civ generator in the game itself doesn't is the "freshness" which is that a civilisation is not repeated until all the civilisations have been iterated through.  

## Features
- **Draw a fresh random civ!**  
*Never draw the same civ twice within the civ pool.*

- **Reset the drawn civ pool at any time!**
*Whenever you want, reset the program and render all enabled civs drawable.*

- **Go to the tech tree!**
*At any time, go to the tech tree of the drawn civ.*

- **Track drawn and remaining civs!**
*See which civs have been drawn and which are remaining on the log tab.*

- **Customise your own civ pool!**
*Tailor the exact civ pool you want using the civ pool tab.*

- **Save your custom civ pool preset!**

*Save your civ pools to a file which can be loadable at any time.*

- **Pick up where you left off!**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cca21d7a-5f0e-44bd-b719-f1e414a85583)  
*Even without saving manually, when the program starts it will remember what civs you had enabled and drawn last time you ran the program. This can be turned off in options if the user prefers the program to reset upon startup.*

- **Quickdraw!**

*The Fresh Random Civ Picker can draw a fresh random civ for you automatically as soon as you start the program. This can be turned off or on in options.*

- **Civ icons!**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c59c287-2e9a-41d5-afc3-7d0ec4466eec)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1cd5977-7811-4ecd-90e6-337dea88e67f)  
*Hear the civ jingle of the civ you draw. Legacy jingles toggleable.*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2fbe3af-29b2-4760-b625-01064f2c4afd)  
*Works the same as Windows run prompt but only accepts AoE2DE lobby code inputs.*

- **Undraw a drawn civ!**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06866ebd-1e9d-4096-a272-6c2e843d2a0f)  
*Go back and undraw the civ you drew with Ctrl+Z. If you change your mind again right away, redraw the undrawn civ with Ctrl+X.*

- **Use hotkeys!**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0941124f-9f4b-4722-9394-67370d760e8b)  
*Most of the program is entirely controllable with key bindings.*

## GUI Description  
The program has a graphical user interface which is a window. This window contains three tabs: "Draw Civ", "Log", and "Civ Pool".  
![tabs gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97fc3d9d-7ffe-4455-9a60-3cb42a53002f)

On the Draw tab the user can draw a fresh random civ and see its icon and hear its jingle. There is also a tech tree button which links to the tech tree of the currently drawn civ.

On the "Log" tab, the user can view the log of drawn civs as well as of remaining civs in the pool.  
![log demo gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0994a260-4cd9-47ac-8e6a-9562c4059237)


On the "Civ Pool" tab, the user can customise which civs are part of the civ pool.

## How do I use this application?
How to use: the user can click the "Draw" button (or press spacebar) to have the centre label display a fresh random civ. There is an indicator at the bottom right which tells how many civs have been drawn so far. If the user wishes to see the tech tree of the drawn civ, they can click the Tech Tree button near the bottom right corner of the window.


Once all civs have been drawn, the next draw will reset the program and all civs are once again available to draw. The user can at any time reset the program manually by clicking the "Reset" button (or pressing Return). The user can at any time navigate to the "Log" tab (by either clicking it or pressing Tab) to view the history of drawn civs. The user can at any time navigate to the "Civ Pool" tab to customise which civs are enabled in the pool. Disabled civs are never drawn.

### Why does Microsoft Defender want to protect my PC against this program?
When you run the executable, Microsoft Defender Smart Screen will give you a popup telling you your PC has been protected. This doesn’t mean that it has scanned the executable, in fact you can go ahead and scan it with Microsoft Defender by right-clicking the executable and clicking "Scan with Microsoft Defender...". The popup only means that it has found that the application application is not digitally signed with a Microsoft-approved certificate. The smart screen popup is warning you that I have not acquired a certificate under the Microsoft Authenticode programme which requires some hundreds of euros in digital signature services per year which I cannot afford at this point in time.

## System requirements

- v1.2: Persistent feature states and automatically logged current civ pool over program lifetimes and sessions
- v1.3: Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+X undraw/redraw feature, ability to save and load presets, and to join AoE2DE lobbies using lobby code


## Why was Fresh Random Civ Picker created?
I got the idea to create this application when I was playing the game one day and got to play the same civilisation twice throughout five matches, despite the fact that I picked random every time and the fact that the game has 45 civilisations. This made me feel frustrated and that I was wasting my time. As a full-time student and with other priorities in life I do not have the time to play the game every day. I might only have the opportunity to play five matches in a month. I want to play random civilisations and I also want to minimise the repetition of some factors like the civilisation played. The frustrating experience of having to replay the same civilisation during my precious few five matches in a game that has 45(!) civilisations gave me the motivation to create a solution for this problem. Thus, the idea, work, and birth of this program came to.
