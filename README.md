This is the C++ GUI version of the Fresh Random Civ Picker.

Purpose of Fresh Random Civ Picker: the user can randomly iterate through the entire civ pool without drawing the same civ twice.

The C++ GUI version: the program has a graphical user interface which is a window. This window contains two tabs. The first tab (titled "Draw"), contains two labels and two buttons. The first label, is centred onto the window and is "?" by default. The second label is anchored to the bottom right corner of the window and is "0/45" by default. The first button is named "Draw" and is positioned just under the first centre label. The second button is named "Reset" and is anchored to the bottom left corner of the window. The second tab (titled Log) contains a text field.

How to use: the user can click the "Draw" button (or press spacebar) to have the centre label display a fresh random civ. There is an indicator at the bottom right which tells how many civs have been drawn so far. Once all civs have been drawn, the next draw will reset the program and all civs are once again available to draw. The user can at any time reset the program manually by clicking the "Reset" button (or pressing Return). The user can at any time navigate to the "Log" tab (by either clicking it or pressing Tab) to view the history of drawn civs from the duration of the current application session.

What is this application?
This is an application which generates a randomly drawn civilisation name out of the civilisations available to play in a computer game called "Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition" which is a real-time strategy game. What my application offers which the random civ name generator in the game itself doesn't is the "freshness" which is that a civilisation is not repeated until all the civilisations have been iterated through.

Why was it created?
I got the idea to create this application when I was playing the game one day and got to play the same civilisation twice throughout five matches, despite the fact that I picked random every time and the fact that the game has 45 civilisations. This made me feel frustrated and that I was wasting my time. As a full-time student and with other priorities in life I do not have the time to play the game every day. I might only have the opportunity to play five matches in a month. I want to play random civilisations and I also want to minimise the repetition of some factors like the civilisations played. The frustrating experience of having to replay the same civilisation during my precious few five matches in a game that has 45(!) civilisations gave me the motivation to create a solution for this problem. Thus, the idea, work, and birth of this program came to.

Planned future features (work in progress):
  - Civ icons
  - Civ jingles
  - UI sounds for a more immersive user experience
  - Options menu to toggle off or on individual features
  - Custom civ pool tab to give the user the ability to customise the exact civ pool they want
  - Tech tree button
